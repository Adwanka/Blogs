**1 what is Shell Scripting for DevOps**

Shell scripting is the use of a collection of Linux commands to carry out, automate, monitor, and optimize a range of actions and processes related to the DevOps workflow. Shell scripting is essential to DevOps because it makes tasks about system management, software development, and deployment automated, consistent, and efficient.

Shell scripting offers numerous benefits, including automation, consistency, cost savings, increased productivity, customization, and the ability to rapidly deploy applications.

It simplifies troubleshooting, supports batch processing, and facilitates integration with other tools. Task scheduling, logging, and monitoring are enhanced, and version control ensures script reliability.

Shell scripts can strengthen security, aid in skill development, work across platforms, and optimize resource management.

These advantages make shell scripting indispensable for system administrators, developers, and DevOps professionals, enabling efficient operations and reliable system and application management.

**2 .What is #!/bin/bash? can we write #!/bin/sh as well?**

**#!/bin/bash** is known as "shebang"

Used at the beginning of shell scripts to specify the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.

This shebang line specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash shell. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular and powerful shell that is commonly available on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.

**Use #!/bin/sh if you wish to guarantee maximum portability and follow POSIX guidelines. #!/bin/bash is appropriate if your script makes use of Bash-specific capabilities.** The requirements and planned execution environment of your script should guide your choice of shebang line.

3 .**Write a Shell Script which prints I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge**
